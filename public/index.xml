          don&amp;rsquo;t use service desks as a means of collaboration inside of an organization.
 Service, or Help Desks are a system that have been in use since the beginning of the internet. We often see companies that deliver software to large user bases have a help desk that is ran by a support team. This brings the company numerous benefits including:
 Cost effective support for confused consumers. Brings better understanding of the software to it&amp;rsquo;s consumers.

          Recently at work I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping to onboard a few new folks. When they run into a technical issue and they ask for help, it is often the case they aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of what the actual problem is. They will often ask about something else entirely that actually isn&amp;rsquo;t the problem that they ran into.1
I often find myself saying something along the lines of
 can you post the whole log?

          Occasionally in go we want convert our structured data into an unstructured format, such as a map[string]interface{}
for struct like:
type Foo struct { A Bar `json:&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;` B Bar `json:&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;` C Bar `json:&amp;#34;c&amp;#34;` D Bar `json:&amp;#34;d&amp;#34;` E Bar `json:&amp;#34;e&amp;#34;` F int `json:&amp;#34;f&amp;#34;` G uint `json:&amp;#34;g&amp;#34;` H string `json:&amp;#34;h&amp;#34;` } type Bar struct { Bar string `json:&amp;#34;bar&amp;#34;` } There are a couple ways we can convert it into a map.
 manually  func base(foo Foo) map[string]interface{} { result := make(map[string]interface{}) result[&amp;#34;A&amp;#34;] = foo.

          is a link aggregator and thats all it should be.
Through a system of anonymity and fake internet points reddit brings attention to things that people generally find interesting or important around a particular topic.
It&amp;rsquo;s not a discussion board. If you debate people on reddit you look naive. You are trying to convince a random person behind a keyboard of a particular viewpoint. You have no idea who that person is.

          Look. I&amp;rsquo;m no genius. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to an ivy league school and I don&amp;rsquo;t have a prestigious list of engineering achievements. I can&amp;rsquo;t help you with your calculus and I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what a state machine is.
The one thing that I have in common with the geniuses that do know these things is that we both are in pursuit of knowledge. We seek to understand the world, bringing light to the unknown.

          I loved playing pokemon games as kid. Problem is that I still love playing them. I&amp;rsquo;ve played pokemon games on emulators at my PC, but sitting at computer after I just sat there all day for my job doesn&amp;rsquo;t really capture the joys of my childhood.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve started to trying to find a handheld device that will let me rexperiance the glory days of the game boy and the nintendo DS.

          This is a guide to a bare metal dual boot of Windows 10 and Ubuntu. No emulation, or virtualization. Most of this guide comes from my personal experiance over several years of having a dual boot install, any pain points that I highlight are because I have experianced them myself. Obiviously, this is not a complete resource of all the information you might need to do this, but this post does have all the information you mighy need.
