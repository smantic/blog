      <description>Look. Im no genius. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to an ivy league school and I don&amp;rsquo;t have a pretigious list of engineering achivements. I can&amp;rsquo;t help you with your calculus and Im not really sure what a state machine is.
The one thing that I have in common with the geniuses that do know these things is that we both are in pursuit of knowledge. We seek to understand the world, bringing light to the unknown.</description>

      <description>I loved playing pokemon games as kid. Problem is that I still love playing them. I&amp;rsquo;ve played pokemon games on emulators at my PC, but sitting at computer after I just sat there all day for my job doesn&amp;rsquo;t really capture the joys of my childhood.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve started to trying to find a handheld device that will let me rexperiance the glory days of the game boy and the nintendo DS.</description>

      <description>This is a guide to a bare metal dual boot of Windows 10 and Ubuntu. No emulation, or virtualization. Most of this guide comes from my personal experiance over several years of having a dual boot install, any pain points that I highlight are because I have experianced them myself. Obiviously, this is not
a complete resource of all the information you might need to do this, but this post does have all the information you mighy need.</description>
