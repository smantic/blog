      <p>Recently at work I&rsquo;ve been helping to onboard a few new folks.
When they run into a technical issue and they ask for help, it is often the case they aren&rsquo;t aware of what the actual problem is.
They will often ask about something else entirely that actually isn&rsquo;t the problem that they ran into.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I often find myself saying something along the lines of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can you post the whole log?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once they do the problem usually becomes immediately clear.</p>
<p>When we get stuck on a problem a lot of the time its because we overlooked some important detail.
Thus we rely on other people to help us identify what we overlooked.
When you don&rsquo;t give someone the whole context of the problem, it&rsquo;s like asking someone to solve a cross word puzzle, but you&rsquo;re only given the clues and a blank grid.</p>
<p>To give the whole context of your problem you should do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>state what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish</li>
<li>state what you&rsquo;re doing</li>
<li>show what you have observed.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the person that is helping you needs more context, that you didn&rsquo;t know to provide they then should prompt you to provide it.</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>post the whole fucking log</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PTWFL for short, or PTWL if you prefer.</p>
<p>It may be a tad bit dramatic or passive aggressive. But it&rsquo;s somewhat warranted since when you ask someone
to help you and you didn&rsquo;t provide a crucial piece of information you are just wasting everyone&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Since it is dramatic, and quick to the point it should only be used when it&rsquo;s immediately clear what context is missing.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> I post online about a issue with hugo that I have encountered, but I don&rsquo;t post the log printed by hugo when I encounter the issue. My question should immediately be replied to by someone telling me to <em>Post the whole fucking log</em>.</p>

<p>this normally shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue given a clean codebase, but we were only just recently a scrappy startup, and our codebase reflects that. But I&rsquo;m sure problems like this are common in most places where people gather and work on software. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
