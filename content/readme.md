Look. Im no genius. I didn't go to an ivy league school 
and I don't have a pretigious list of engineering achivements. 
I can't help you with your calculus and Im not really sure what a state machine is.  
The one thing that I have in common with the geniuses that do know these things is that we 
both are in pursuit of knowledge. We seek to understand the world, bringing light to the unknown.
It's the pursuit of truth and the nature of this blog. By trade I am a software enginer so
I spend most of my days seeking to understand computers and the things we use them for. 
Most of which is expressed and explained through language. 

I want to explore and understand the truth created from the langauges that make up software, thus the name for the blog, semantics; the study of truth.
