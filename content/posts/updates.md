Hello! Been about 6 mo since I posted a blog, wanted to post some housekeeping updates. 

1. Thankfully a maintainer has been found for all the gorilla libraries. As they make changes to gorilla I will encourage others to continue using the main repo so that I do not have to any longer maintain my fork and maybe eventually remove my fork completely. 
2. I plan on revamping my site including moving away from hugo completely, maybe a custom solution for me. But will probably be a while till I really get around to it. While I do that I may go back and revist some old articles to touch them up or completely rewrite them. I'll leave a note if I do so.
