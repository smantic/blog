The tech industry is harboring a giant unspoken secret. You're not suppose to talk about it, it's taboo.

# Most people in the tech industry don't know what they're doing.


The truth of the matter, is that the tech industry is still very, very young. 
Not too long ago all of the tech giants were still considered disruptors (and may still be). Nowadays they have been busy evolving into titans of industry. 
This goes for developers since they have been required to work with changing and evolving technologies, while navigating complex requirements and applications of the technology.
But this also applies to the people that work with developers, mainly product managers, business managers, and people managers.

Shipping software product very much is a novel idea, with few if any parallels to existing professions (I couldn't name you one off the top of my head).
There isn't much that school will teach you to be able to do this effectively.
